# Poisson error

## Schema

- Average time between events (in seconds)
- Percent of events that are burst events
- Percent of events that are single events
- Average burst length (in seconds)
- Burst Length Variance (in seconds)

-- Burst length is modeled as a gaussian variable

## Gamma Ray Burst Example

- average time between events: 10 minutes
- percent of events that are burst events: 0
- percent of events that are single events: 100
- average burst length: 0
- burst length variance: 0

## Bursty example

Might be caused by microscopic dust clouds, etc.

- average time between events: 60 minutes
- percent of events that are burst events: 100
- percent of events that are single events: 0
- average burst length: 1 minute
- burst length variance: 30 seconds

## Other Examples

We can mix and match these parameters to create other examples
