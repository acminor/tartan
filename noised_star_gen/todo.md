- [ ] Mis-prediction Error
   - Useful for knowing the algorithm's susceptibility to error
   - Some algorithms need a constant star to operate/operate optimally
   - One way of fixing this is to predict and subtract the prediction to make a constant star
   - This allows us to put a bound of how good our prediction must be for the algorithm to operate correctly
   - (see improvement_2)
- [ ] Poisson Error
   - Useful for errors such as Gamma Ray Burst
   - Also useful for modeling time between burst noise segments
   - Will program for a mixture of these (see improvement_1)
